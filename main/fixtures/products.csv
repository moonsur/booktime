The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life,"<p>In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.</p>

<p>For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.</p>

<p>Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.</p>

<p>There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</p>",Self Development | Motivational  | Self-Help,The Subtle Art of Not Giving.jpg,12,Mark Manson
Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World,"<p>On May 17, 2014, Admiral William H. McRaven addressed the graduating class of the University of Texas at Austin on their Commencement day.

<p>Admiral McRaven's original speech went viral with over 10 million views.

Forbes magazine named Gifts one of the ""Five Books That Will Actually Change Your Outlook On Life."" Through this self-help classicwe find courage to overcome paralyzing fear and self-consciousness, strengthening our connection to the world and helping us to believe we are worthy of self-discovery, personal growth, and boundless love.</p>

<p>A motivational and inspiring guide to wholehearted living, rather than just the average self-help book, with this groundbreaking work Brené Brown, Ph.D., bolsters the self-esteem and personal development process through her characteristic heartfelt, honest storytelling. With original research and plenty of encouragement, she explores the psychology of releasing our definitions of an “imperfect” life and embracing living authentically. Brown’s “ten guideposts”  are benchmarks for authenticity that can help anyone establish a practice for a life of honest beauty—a perfectly imperfect life.</p>

<p>Now more than ever, we all need to cultivate feelings of self-worth, as well as acceptance and love for ourselves. In a world where insults, criticisms, and fears are spread too generously alongside messages of unrealistic beauty, attainment, and expectation, we look for ways to “dig deep” and find truth and gratitude in our lives. A new way forward means we can’t hold on too tightly to our own self-defeating thoughts or the displaced pain in our world. Instead, we can embrace the imperfection.</p>",Self Development | Creativity | Self-Help,The Gifts of Imperfection.jpg,8,Brené Brown

"Becoming the One: Heal Your Past, Transform Your Relationship Patterns, and Come Home to Yourself","<p>Romantic relationships have the ability to infuse our lives with the magic of intimacy and connection. But for many of us, that magic is fleeting—over and over, our relationships don't last, or if they do, they fail to make us happy. We find ourselves chasing unavailable love, sublimating our needs in service to others, or trying to save our partners from themselves, all the while abandoning the one who needs us most—ourselves.</p>

<p>If you find yourself struggling to let go after a relationship ends, or you keep hitting the same wall in dating and relationships with emotionally unavailable people, this is not a sign that you are broken. It is a sign that somewhere along the way, you learned to sacrifice yourself in order to be loved. In Becoming the One, spiritual leader and visionary founder of the Rising Woman community Sheleana Aiyana offers a road map for transforming your relationship patterns to end the cycle of self-abandonment and move into the light of self-discovery.</p>",Self Development | Happiness  | Self-Help,Becoming the One.jpg,9,Sheleana Aiyana

Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention - and How to Think Deeply Again,"<p>In the United States, teenagers can focus on one task for only 65 seconds at a time, and office workers average only three minutes. Like so many of us, Johann Hari was finding that constantly switching from device to device and tab to tab was a diminishing and depressing way to live. He tried all sorts of self-help solutions - even abandoning his phone for three months - but nothing seemed to work. So Hari went on an epic journey across the world to interview the leading experts on human attention - and he discovered that everything we think we know about this crisis is wrong.</p>

<p>We think our inability to focus is a personal failure to exert enough willpower over our devices. The truth is even more disturbing: Our focus has been stolen by powerful external forces that have left us uniquely vulnerable to corporations determined to raid our attention for profit. Hari found that there are 12 deep causes of this crisis, from the decline of mind-wandering to rising pollution, all of which have robbed some of our attention. In Stolen Focus, he introduces listeners to Silicon Valley dissidents who learned to hack human attention, and veterinarians who diagnose dogs with ADHD. He explores a favela in Rio de Janeiro where everyone lost their attention in a particularly surreal way, and an office in New Zealand that discovered a remarkable technique to restore workers’ productivity.</p>

<p>Crucially, Hari learned how we can reclaim our focus - as individuals, and as a society - if we are determined to fight for it. Stolen Focus will transform the debate about attention and finally show us how to get it back.</p>",Self Development | Memory Improvement  | Self-Help,Stolen Focus.jpg,14,Johann Hari

Love Yourself & Lose Weight: The Success Story of Self Love,"<h4>WANT A NEW APPROACH TO WEIGHT LOSS?</h4>
<p>Diets not working for you? Feeling fed up? This book is for anyone who wants to make a change in their lives.</p>

<h4>DIETS ALONE DON’T WORK</h4>

<p>There’s a reason restrictive diets and strict exercise regimes don’t work. Technically, any regime will work if you can ‘stick at it’, but sticking at it is hard. To make a big change we need to change our mindset first.</p>

<h4>THIS IS A REVOLUTIONARY NEW WEIGHT LOSS METHOD</h4>

<p>To do what’s necessary to shift weight via any diet or exercise regime, first you have to fix your relationship with you. Love Yourself & Lose Weight offers a revolutionary and visionary approach to weight loss that’s not about the food you eat or the calories you burn, no, it’s simply all about you.</p>

<p>If you don’t accept, like, and love yourself, you’re missing a key ingredient to any weight loss regime - you're missing what you need to make the change. Without self love, the chances are stacked against you and it’s more likely that whatever you try will fail.</p>

<h4>SELF LOVE IS THE KEY</h4>

<p>What if learning to absolutely love yourself could be the key?</p>

<p>“With self-love on my side I lost over 85 pounds forever. I’m sharing my secrets of self-love to help you lose weight too. If I can do it, anyone can!”</p>

<h4>A TRANSFORMATIONAL STORY</h4>

<p>This is the success story of self-love. Katie shares her personal, funny and inspirational story of how she found and harnessed self-love to achieve massive and permanent weight loss.</p>

<p>At the age of 38, Katie was 85 pounds overweight and miserable about it. She didn’t want to wake up feeling disappointed anymore, she knew she needed a change and she knew diets had never worked. A year and a half later, having discovered the power of self-love, she had lost over 85 pounds, changed her shape, and changed her outlook on pretty much everything.</p>

<h4>THE POWER OF SELF LOVE</h4>

<p>This book explains the psychology and power of self-love as a catalyst for weight loss. Instead of achieving self-love as a result of weight loss, Love Yourself & Lose Weight helps readers to achieve self-love today! Loving yourself today, whatever weight you are, will enable you to eat consciously, move your body, delight in your weight loss journey, and feel great about being you.</p>",Self Development | Health | Self-Help,Love Yourself & Lose Weight.jpg,14,Katie Lips
